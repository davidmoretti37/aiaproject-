# Professional Audio Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a professional-grade audio system for the AIA project, providing smooth transitions and real-time feedback similar to OpenAI, Google, and Apple's voice assistants.

## Architecture

### 1. Professional Audio Service (`lib/professional_audio_service.dart`)
- **Real-time audio streaming** with Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- **Professional audio session management** with proper iOS/Android configurations
- **Smooth transitions** between listening, processing, and speaking states
- **Volume-reactive breathing** for visual feedback
- **Automatic silence detection** for seamless user experience

### 2. Enhanced Server (`professional_ai_server.js`)
- **Real-time transcription streaming** endpoint (`/transcribe-stream`)
- **Professional TTS** using OpenAI's latest models
- **Audio file management** with automatic cleanup
- **Voice Activity Detection** support
- **Whisper integration** for high-quality transcription

### 3. Enhanced UI (`lib/enhanced_cinematic_intro.dart`)
- **Volume-reactive orb breathing** that responds to voice input
- **State-aware visual feedback** with color changes
- **Smooth transformation animations** between orb and chat interface
- **Professional audio state management**

## Key Features

### Real-Time Audio Processing
```dart
// Professional audio service initialization
final audioService = ProfessionalAudioService();
await audioService.initialize();

// Start listening with real-time feedback
await audioService.startListening(
  onPartialResult: (transcription) {
    // Real-time transcription updates
  },
  onVolumeLevel: (level) {
    // Volume-reactive visual feedback
  },
  onStateChange: (audioState) {
    // Professional state management
  },
);
```

### Voice Activity Detection
- **Automatic silence detection** after 1 second of silence
- **Volume threshold configuration** for different environments
- **Real-time volume level monitoring** for visual feedback

### Professional TTS
- **OpenAI TTS-1 model** for high-quality speech synthesis
- **Multiple voice options** (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
- **Speed control** for natural conversation flow
- **Automatic audio file management**

### Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Master breathing animation** that never stops
- **Volume-reactive scaling** based on voice input
- **State-aware color changes**:
  - Blue: Idle state
  - Green-Cyan: Listening (varies with volume)
  - Orange: Processing
  - Purple: Speaking

## Server Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check with feature list
- `POST /chat` - Traditional text chat (compatibility)
- `POST /transcribe-stream` - Real-time audio transcription
- `POST /transcribe-final` - Final transcription processing
- `POST /tts` - Text-to-speech generation
- `GET /audio/:filename` - Audio file serving

### Professional Audio Endpoints
- `POST /transcribe-audio` - File-based Whisper transcription
- `POST /vad` - Voice Activity Detection
- `GET /agents` - Available AI agents

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Flutter Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  # Professional audio packages
  flutter_sound: ^9.2.13
  audio_session: ^0.1.16
  permission_handler: ^10.4.3
  wakelock: ^0.6.2
  just_audio: ^0.9.34
  record: ^4.4.4
  
  # Enhanced animations
  flutter_animate: ^4.5.0
  simple_animations: ^5.0.2
  lottie: ^3.0.0
```

### 2. Server Dependencies
```bash
npm install express cors openai multer
```

### 3. Permissions Setup

#### iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`)
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for voice interaction with AIA</string>
<key>NSAudioSessionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses audio sessions for professional voice interaction</string>
```

#### Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Start the Professional Server
```bash
node professional_ai_server.js
```

### 2. Run the Flutter App
```bash
flutter run
```

### 3. Interaction Flow
1. **Intro Sequence**: Lottie animation → Forest zoom → Orb reveal
2. **Voice Interaction**: Tap orb → Professional listening with real-time feedback
3. **Processing**: Smooth transition to processing state with visual feedback
4. **Response**: Professional TTS with synchronized visual breathing
5. **Chat Mode**: Transform to chat interface for continued interaction

## Professional Features

### Audio Quality
- **16kHz sample rate** for optimal quality/performance balance
- **PCM 16-bit encoding** for professional audio processing
- **Real-time audio streaming** with 100ms chunks
- **Professional audio session configuration** for iOS/Android

### Visual Feedback
- **Never-stopping breathing animation** for lifelike feel
- **Volume-reactive scaling** (1.0x to 1.2x based on voice level)
- **State-aware breathing speed** (0.5x to 4.0x based on interaction)
- **Smooth color transitions** between states

### Performance Optimizations
- **Audio buffer management** for smooth streaming
- **Automatic file cleanup** every hour
- **Memory-efficient animation controllers**
- **Optimized network requests** with proper error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone permissions**: Ensure proper permissions in Info.plist/AndroidManifest.xml
2. **Server connection**: Check network connectivity and server URL
3. **Audio playback**: Verify audio session configuration
4. **Performance**: Monitor memory usage with multiple audio streams

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check server health
curl http://192.168.3.54:8000/health

# Test TTS endpoint
curl -X POST http://192.168.3.54:8000/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello, this is a test"}'
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real Whisper integration** for production-quality transcription
- **Advanced VAD algorithms** for better silence detection
- **Multi-language support** for global accessibility
- **Custom voice training** for personalized TTS
- **Noise cancellation** for better audio quality

### Performance Improvements
- **WebSocket streaming** for lower latency
- **Audio compression** for bandwidth optimization
- **Caching strategies** for frequently used audio
- **Background processing** for smoother UI
